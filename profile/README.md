I build **reproducible, production-grade systems** for teams that have outgrown ad-hoc workflows.

That usually means turning **click-ops, tribal knowledge, and fragile prototypes** into **auditable, repeatable platforms**—with clear constraints, measurable performance, and sane operational defaults.

This GitHub org is where we publish **reference implementations, playbooks, and NDA-safe engineering artifacts** drawn from real-world systems work.

**Current engagements / partnerships:** RetroKrafters, ROImantics, Fractions Infra.

## What you'll find here
_Reproducible systems_

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Cloud Operations
- Terraform-first workflows
- Drift detection, control, and audit trails
- Environment promotion (dev → staging → prod) with guardrails
- “Boring” infrastructure patterns that scale

### 🤖 AI / ML Systems
- End-to-end delivery (training → serving → operations)
- Reproducibility, versioning, and observability
- Failure modes, rollback strategies, and operational tradeoffs
- GPU-aware system design

### ⚙️ Systems & Performance Engineering
- Systems primitives: state, streams, schedulers, mechanics
- Hybrid CPU–GPU architectures
- Pathfinding, simulation, and performance-sensitive workloads
- Real-time data and low-latency patterns (often with Redis)

### 🧪 Applied Engineering Labs
- Multiplayer backend systems and real-time game services
- Computer vision pipelines and edge inference
- Low-resource UI/embedded systems (LVGL, Raspberry Pi)

Everything here is **mechanism-driven**, not demo-driven.

## TF-141 Labs
TF-141 Labs is our applied engineering lab within this organization.

We’re a small team (**~4–5 people**) focused on:
- Building and documenting repeatable infrastructure + AI workflows
- Publishing reference systems and playbooks
- Sharing debrief-first engineering thinking: constraints, tradeoffs, failure modes

---

## How to use this organization
- Start with each repository’s README—context matters
- Treat repos as **reference implementations**, not copy-paste templates
- Expect explicit constraints, tradeoffs, and documented failure cases
- Prefer “boring” defaults unless the problem truly demands complexity

If something looks boring, it’s probably intentional.

---

## Want a quick sanity check on your stack?
If your **cloud / data / AI setup feels fragile**, we can do a practical assessment:
- where it’s drifting,
- what failure modes you’re exposed to,
- and what the smallest stabilizing changes look like.

No pitch deck.  
No obligation.  
Just a clear diagnosis and a concrete path forward.
