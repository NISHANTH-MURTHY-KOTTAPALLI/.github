# NISHANTH MURTHY KOTTAPALLI

**Hands-on AI & Infrastructure Architect**  
---

I design, audit, and stabilize **cloud, data, and AI systems** for teams that have outgrown ad-hoc workflows.

My work focuses on converting **click-ops, tribal knowledge, and experimental setups** into **auditable, repeatable, production-grade platforms**- without unnecessary complexity or hype.

This GitHub organization is where I publish **reference implementations, playbooks, and NDA-safe engineering artifacts** drawn from real-world systems work.

## What you'll find here

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Cloud Operations
- Terraform-first workflows
- Drift detection and control
- Environment promotion and auditability
- “Boring” infrastructure patterns that scale

### 🤖 AI / ML Systems
- End-to-end delivery (training → serving → operations)
- Reproducibility, versioning, and observability
- Failure modes and operational tradeoffs
- GPU-aware system design

### ⚙️ Systems & Performance Engineering
- Redis as a systems primitive (state, streams, mechanics)
- Hybrid CPU-GPU architectures
- Pathfinding, simulation, and performance-sensitive workloads

### 🧪 Applied Engineering Labs
- Multiplayer backend systems
- Computer vision pipelines
- Edge and low-resource UI systems (LVGL, Raspberry Pi)

Everything published here is **mechanism-driven**, not demo-driven.
Most of the work in this organization is published under **TF141-LABS** - my applied engineering lab.

## TF141-LABS

TF141-LABS exists to:
- Document repeatable infrastructure and AI workflows
- Publish playbooks and reference systems
- Share calm, debrief-first engineering thinking

No client work.  
No services catalog.  
No hype demos.

Just systems that survive contact with reality.

---

## How to use this organization

- Start with the README of any repository - context matters
- Treat repositories as **reference implementations**, not copy-paste templates
- Expect clear constraints, tradeoffs, and documented failure modes

If something looks boring, it's probably intentional.

---

## Need a fast sanity check on your own setup?

If your **cloud or AI stack feels fragile**, there is a single entry point:

No pitch deck.  
No obligation.  
Just a practical assessment of where things are drifting and why.
